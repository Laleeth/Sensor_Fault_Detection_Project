=======
The Air Pressure System (APS) is an important part of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses air to apply pressure to the brake pads and slow down the vehicle. One of the benefits of using an APS is that air is readily available and sustainable.

This is a classification problem where the goal is to predict whether a failure was caused by a specific component of the APS or by something else. The positive class indicates that the failure was caused by a component of the APS, while the negative class indicates that the failure was caused by something else.

To minimize unnecessary repairs and reduce costs, the aim is to minimize false predictions. To achieve this, we will use Python, FastAPI, machine learning algorithms, Docker, and MongoDB.
